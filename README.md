# Parallel-Code-Performance-Problem-Classification-with-ChatGPT
The detection and diagnosis of performance issues in parallel codes pose significant challenges, particularly in the context of large-scale applications. This project aims to overcome these challenges by leveraging the capabilities of large language models, specifically ChatGPT. Our objective is to develop an automated pipeline capable of identifying and categorizing performance problems in parallel codes, thereby enhancing the efficiency and optimization of applications.
In pursuit of this goal, we drew inspiration from the research article titled "An Empirical Study of High Performance Computing (HPC) Performance Bugs"\footnote{Shull, F., Carver, J., Hochstein, L.; Basili, V. (2005). Empirical study design in the area of high-performance computing (HPC). 2005 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering, 2005. https://doi.org/10.1109/isese.2005.1541839 }. This paper presents an extensive investigation into various problem types and corresponding solutions in open source high-performance computing projects. Building upon the insights gained from this study, we constructed a pipeline that effectively utilizes the data provided, employing ChatGPT to reproduce the reported outcomes. Consequently, we assess the performance of ChatGPT in terms of its ability to interpret the semantics of parallel computing code. Finally, we present the obtained results, offering our insights and perspectives on the potential use cases and broader applicability of large language models in this domain.
